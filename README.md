# SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm

Load California housing data, select features and targets, and split into training and testing sets. 2.Scale both X (features) and Y (targets) using StandardScaler. 3.Use SGDRegressor wrapped in MultiOutputRegressor to train on the scaled training data. 4.Predict on test data, inverse transform the results, and calculate the mean squared error.

## Program:
```

from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor
from sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Code cell
data = fetch_california_housing()

# Select first 3 features (for demonstration)
X = data.data[:, :3]   # shape (n_samples, 3)

# Create a multi-output target: [median_house_value, some_other_numeric_column]
# Here we use column index 6 (for demonstration) as the second output
Y = np.column_stack((data.target, data.data[:, 6]))

print("X shape:", X.shape)
print("Y shape:", Y.shape)
print("Example X (first row):", X[0])
print("Example Y (first row):", Y[0])

# Code cell
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

print("Train shapes:", X_train.shape, Y_train.shape)
print("Test shapes: ", X_test.shape, Y_test.shape)

# Code cell
scaler_X = StandardScaler()
scaler_Y = StandardScaler()

# Fit on training data and transform both train and test
X_train_scaled = scaler_X.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler_X.transform(X_test)

Y_train_scaled = scaler_Y.fit_transform(Y_train)

print("Scaled X_train mean (approx):", X_train_scaled.mean(axis=0))
print("Scaled Y_train mean (approx):", Y_train_scaled.mean(axis=0))

# Code cell
sgd = SGDRegressor(max_iter=1000, tol=1e-3, random_state=42)  # you can also set alpha, eta0, penalty etc.
multi_output_sgd = MultiOutputRegressor(sgd)

# Fit on scaled training data
multi_output_sgd.fit(X_train_scaled, Y_train_scaled)
